# K-Nearest-Neighbor
In pattern recognition, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression.[1] In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm


Input:<br> 
  filename.csv<br>
  M rows and N columns<br>
  Nth column must be a class<br>
  <br>
  training data (input training data need to be randomized)<br>
  testing data <br>
  
Output:<br>
  List of actual and predicted class<br>
  Accuracy
