# K-Nearest-Neighbor
In pattern recognition, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression.[1] In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm
